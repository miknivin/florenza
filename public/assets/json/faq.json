Sometimes people put the frequently asked questions section on their Contact page, but you can create your own page and put it right in your website navigation menu or website footer so it’s easy to find. Getting a straight, quick answer to your question is a relief. So keep answers to a short paragraph if you can, less than 100 words. Answer the entire question in the FAQ without linking away to another page"
